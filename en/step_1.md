+ Select which tool(s) you will use for the shape(s) you want 

**Circle** tool: Select the **Circle** tool and drag your mouse (or finger if you are using a tablet) to draw a circle. Hold down shift to draw a perfect circle.

+ If you use varying colours for the shapes, you may need to use the **Front** and **Back** tools in the Paint editor to move your shapes forward or backward so that they are positioned correctly within your background.

+ You can select all the shapes and **Group** them together so that you can adjust them or move them as one shape.
