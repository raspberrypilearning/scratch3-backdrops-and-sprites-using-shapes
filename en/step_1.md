You can create backdrops and costumes for sprites in the Paint editor, using just shapes.

Go to the **Choose a Sprite** or **Choose a Backdrop** menu and choose the **Paint** option:

Select which tool(s) you will use for the shape(s) that you want: 

+ **Circle**: Click on the **Circle** tool to draw a circle. Press and hold the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key on your keyboard to draw a perfect circle.

You can use the **Fill** tool to change the colour of a shape:

You may need to use the **Forward** and **Backward** tools to move your shapes forward or backward so that they are positioned correctly within your image:

You can select all the shapes and **Group** them together so that you can adjust them or move them as one shape:

Here is an example of a sprite created with the **Circle** and **Rectangle** tools:

</div>


Remember to name the costumes and backdrops that you create in the Paint editor.
