You may need to use the **Front** and **Back** tools to move your shapes forward or backward so that they are positioned correctly within your painting.

You can select all the shapes and **Group** them together so that you can adjust them or move them as one shape.

Here is an example of a sprite created with the **Circle** and **Rectangle** tools:
